## Description
We were tasked to understand the differences between Twitter and Instagram posts on a chosen issue. Our team decided to conduct analysis on Donald Trump’s second impeachment. News on Trump’s impeachment has garnered much attention from around the world and millions of people were sharing their thoughts and opinions on social media platforms. We scraped data using Python packages, Twint for Twitter and InstaLoader for Instagram.

## Dataset
Social media data scraped from Twitter can be found [here](https://github.com/joshuawong96/Trump-Impeachment-Analysis/blob/master/Combined%20Analysis/Final%20Datasets/twitter_comments_processed.csv) and data scraped from Instagram can be found [here](https://github.com/joshuawong96/Trump-Impeachment-Analysis/blob/master/Combined%20Analysis/Final%20Datasets/instagram_comments_processed.csv).

## Analysis
Our analysis can be found in the Jupyter notebook [Trump_Impeachment_Analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/joshuawong96/Trump-Impeachment-Analysis/blob/master/Combined%20Analysis/Trump_Impeachment_Analysis.ipynb) and our insights can be found in a summarised 2-page report [Trump Impeachment Analysis Report](https://github.com/joshuawong96/Trump-Impeachment-Analysis/blob/master/Trump%20Impeachment%20Analysis%20Report.pdf).
